# file_organizer
A simple file organizer made for personal use, for practice.

>If you're really going to use this, I'd recommend making a backup of your files first. I'm just practicing here.

## Instructions:

* Download the .exe file from the Releases section.
* Follow the on-screen instructions once you open it. I'd recommend moving the executable to the path you want to run it at.
* Make sure you don't have any files from that directory open otherwise it will just crash.
* If you run the executable in the directory you will be organizing, it will probably get moved around as well. Find it in the executables or .exe folder, depending on the options you've used.
